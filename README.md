# Frag Battles
A simple nodejs terminal application that runs a round robin style tournament to find your best fragrances per category. 

I wrote it for myself. 

How to: 

1. Download the code from this github (top right)
2. Learn how to run it: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial
3. Update the data.json file with your collection. You can use something like ChatGPT to categorise and create the correct format for you. 

How I use it: 

I run wrist tests using decants that I have bought and enter the results in here. Hopefully it will give me an educated decision on what I like and what I want to buy. ChatGPT or other AI tools can help categorise, create the data.json and offer similarities etc.
